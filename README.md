##CLEAN Arquitecture
I'm try to implement a clean arquitecture wit this directory tree



## Some interesting packages

To develop this technical test I'm try to use as few packages as possible but to take less time to make some amazing features i need to use more package, and there are some that I discovered during this amazing trip 

####DartZ
`dartz: ^0.10.0-nullsafety.1`
Although Dart is already a typed and compiled language but with the properties of an interpreted language, Functional programming is an interesting approach and it seems to solve a lot of problems

I didn't know it's full potential and I only used the tuple typing for objects called 'Either', as soon as possible I want to study this approach
####Equatable
`equatable: ^2.0.2`
A very simply and fast way to do Objects comparations, we can indicate wich properties of an object wil be considered to comapare two objects instead of do the manual implementation and overridings. 

## Flutter Internazionalization üó∫Ô∏è
You can read the complete tutorial [Official internationalization guide for Flutter][l10n_link]

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "home": "Home",
    "@home": {
        "description": "Home label description"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "home": "Home",
    "@home": {
        "description": "Home label description"
    }
    "profile": "Perfil",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Profile label description"
    }
}
```

3. Instance the translated String

```dart
import 'package:movies_trending/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```
4. ### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
You need to run the `gen-l10n` command, after you create your's `.arb` files  because the files at `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n` will not be generated automatically.

```sh
flutter gen-l10n
```


Along of my research for the best way to implement internationalization i found an interesting plugin for VsCode  and Android Studio that named [Flutter Intl][vs_flutter_intl] It was an easy and automated implementation,but this time i opt for the official flutter guide.
